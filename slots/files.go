// ErrFileSource reports a files entry whose source could not be resolved. It
// names the path, which the library's own error cannot: the resolver is handed
// a slot and knows nothing about the manifest entry the slot was built from.

// ResolveFiles turns a manifest's files entries into the content each is
// planted with. A literal passes through untouched; a source is resolved
// through the same resolvers a slot uses.
//
// It runs commands and makes requests, so it belongs here and in the
// composition root rather than in a renderer — the same rule [Assemble]
// follows, and for the same reason.
//
// **A source that fails fails the boot**, which is the opposite of a slot. A
// slot that does not resolve leaves a section out of the boot file and the
// agent asks its tools instead; a file that does not resolve leaves a hole at
// a path the profile promised, and nothing downstream can notice it is
// missing. The two are different failures and they get different answers.
//
// A source that resolves to nothing is not a failure and plants an empty file.
// The resolver was reached and answered; that the answer was empty is content,
// and content is a black box here. The slots are therefore declared
// non-required deliberately — the library's Required flag fails the assembly
// on an empty result as well as on a failed one, and conflating those two
// would turn `torque task list` finding no tasks into a boot that will not
// start.
//
// A manifest that declares no files, or only literals, resolves nothing and
// makes no calls.
