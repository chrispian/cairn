// Package slots resolves a profile manifest's slot declarations into the
// content a boot directory's boot.md is written from.
//
// The resolving is not Cairn's. agentkit's agentcontext owns the slot kinds,
// the resolvers, the per-slot timeouts and headers, the byte and token
// budgets, the per-slot provenance, and the determinism contract — including
// the rule that a non-required slot whose resolver fails records the failure
// on its result instead of blocking the assembly. What lives here is the
// wiring between a [profile.Spec] and that library, and deliberately nothing
// more: three portfolio libraries each grew their own context pipeline before
// agentcontext was extracted to end exactly that.
