// service lives without hardcoding a host that differs between machines, and
// without cairn growing a second configuration file to hold one. Expanding a
// command line as well would make the environment able to rewrite what runs,
// which is a larger promise than "say where to read from" — a cmd slot already
// runs through a shell that does its own expansion, so nothing is lost by
// leaving it alone.

// diagnostic quotes, and an error naming an expanded value would name something
// the operator never wrote.
