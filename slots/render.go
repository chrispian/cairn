// DropUnresolved is an [agentcontext.Renderer] that removes every slot which
// produced no content — whether because its resolver failed or because it
// resolved to nothing — and delegates what remains to the renderer it wraps.
//
// The library's own renderer emits a bare section heading for both cases, so a
// boot file ends up carrying headings with nothing under them. Cairn omits the
// section instead, which is also what Tether's boot template does.
//
// An earlier revision rendered a failure marker in place of the missing
// content, to keep "the service returned nothing" distinguishable from "the
// service was unreachable". That was wrong on both counts. It is cairn
// authoring prose into the agent's context, which this package has no standing
// to do — a boot file carries what a profile declared, and a sentence cairn
// invented is one nobody can correct. And the distinction it preserved is not
// the agent's to act on: current truth comes from the tools, not from a
// snapshot, so an agent that needs the data asks for it.
//
// The failure is not swallowed. It stays on the [agentcontext.SlotResult] the
// caller receives, and the caller reports it on stderr — to the operator, who
// can fix it. It simply does not reach the file.
//
// Filtering and delegating is deliberate. Ordering, budget enforcement,
// truncation and drop accounting all stay the wrapped renderer's.

// its heading comes back from here rather than being written around the marker,
// a template cannot be left holding a heading with nothing under it.
//
// A slot that declares no section renders bare content — see the body of this
// function for why the library's name-as-heading fallback is not what a
// template wants.
