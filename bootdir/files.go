// renderFiles returns the arbitrary files a profile's manifest declares, each
// planted at its own path with its own content and nothing added to either.
//
// This is the manifest's escape hatch: content that has to reach a boot
// directory and is not one of the artifacts cairn knows by name rides here,
// and cairn neither reads it nor asks what it is for.
//
// The content arrives on the instance already resolved — see [Instance].Files.
// A manifest entry may name a slot source rather than a literal, and resolving
// one runs commands and makes requests, which a renderer may not do.
//
// The paths are emitted in sorted order, because a map has none and a
// rendering has to be the same twice. Whether a path can name something inside
// the boot directory is [Render]'s question — it asks it of every renderer, so
// asking it again here would be a second opinion that could disagree.
