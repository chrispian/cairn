// contentKind is one collection of authored content a boot directory carries:
// the manifest keys that declare it and name its directory, the nouns a
// diagnostic calls it by, and the sentinels a refusal wraps.
//
// Skills and prompts are the two, and everything they share is written once
// against this — resolving the source directory, and checking that a declared
// name is one entry directly beneath it. The second of those is a containment
// rule, and a containment rule with two copies is one relaxation away from a
// name that escapes its directory.
//
// What is not shared is what each collection is: a skill is a directory copied
// whole, a prompt is one file substituted. Those live in their own renderers.

	// diagnostic names it — "skills", "install.skills", "prompts".

// machine, and writing it out in full in every profile is how it goes stale.
// Both the environment and home are the instance's rather than the process's,
// so that a renderer reads nothing outside the instance it was handed.

// directory cairn happened to be invoked from, which is not a property of the
