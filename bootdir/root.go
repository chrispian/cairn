// ErrForeignRepository reports a boot root that resolves inside a git working
// tree which is not the one the scope belongs to.
//
// A boot directory is the agent's working directory. Every git command the
// session runs therefore resolves against whatever working tree contains the
// boot root, while the slots in that same boot.md resolve against the scope —
// so an agent booted from a foreign checkout is handed two accounts of which
// repository it is in, and its shell answers with the wrong one. Nothing about
// that is loud: `git add -A && git commit` succeeds, against a tree the agent
// never touched.
var ErrForeignRepository = errors.New("boot root is inside a repository that is not the scope's")

// CheckRoot reports [ErrForeignRepository] when root resolves inside a git
// working tree other than the one scopeDir belongs to. A root inside the
// scope's own working tree passes, and so does a root inside no working tree
// at all.
//
// This refuses rather than warns, for three reasons. Cairn already refuses the
// neighbouring hazard — a boot directory at or inside the scope, see
// [github.com/chrispian/cairn/scope.CheckBootDir] — so refusal is the
// established answer for "cairn is about to write somewhere that will confuse
// the session it is writing for". The failure this catches is silent and
// plausible by construction, and a warning printed by a boot that then exits 0
// and prints a path is a line an operator scrolls past on the way to the path.
// And the boot root is a startup-time property: an operator sets it once, in a
// launcher or an environment file, and fixes it once. A per-boot surprise
// would be a different argument.
//
// The probe is one [os.Lstat] per ancestor looking for a ".git" entry, on two
// paths — roughly a dozen syscalls for a boot that already reads a catalog,
// runs whatever `cmd` slots the profile declares, and makes whatever requests
// its `http_*` slots declare. The cost is not a reason to weaken the answer.
//
// Detection is structural and nothing here shells out. `git rev-parse
// --show-toplevel` is the obvious instrument and the worse one: it needs git
// installed, it needs a subprocess, and it reads a set of environment
// variables — GIT_DIR, GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES — that would make the answer
// depend on the caller's environment, which is precisely what this package
// does not do. Walking up for the marker depends on neither.
//
// Both paths are passed rather than read. Nothing in this package consults the
// process environment; see [DefaultRoot], which takes [EnvBootRoot]'s value as
// an argument for the same reason.
//
// The empty scope passes. It declares no target, so there is no repository to
// contradict and no scope the message could name — the same answer
// [github.com/chrispian/cairn/scope.Contains] gives an empty ancestor. That
// leaves a boot with no declared scope unguarded, which is a real gap and a
// deliberate one: this check is defined as "a repository other than the
// declared scope", and with nothing declared it has no question to ask.
