// resolveSubagents turns the ids a profile names under spec.subagents into the
// declarations their definitions are rendered from.
//
// It resolves here rather than in a renderer for the reason slots and files
// do: it reads another profile out of the catalog and walks an extends chain,
// and a renderer consults nothing beyond the instance it is handed. What
// crosses over is one opaque JSON value per id — the named profile's own
// spec.subagent — so nothing else about a named profile reaches the boot
// directory of the profile that named it.
//
// A named profile is resolved through the same cascade a booted one is, so a
// subagent declaration may be inherited or restated like any other manifest
// key.
//
// Three refusals, each naming the id and the profile that named it:
//
//   - An id with no profile. It comes back from the cascade, which says which
//     profile referenced it.
//   - An abstract profile, matching `cairn boot`. An abstract profile exists
//     to be extended; a definition is something the harness runs, and running
//     a template runs a profile its author marked unrunnable.
//   - A profile declaring no spec.subagent. The definition would be a file
//     with a name and nothing else — a path the booting profile promised, with
//     nothing declared to put at it.
//
// Depth is one by construction. This walks the ids the booting profile named
// and stops; a named profile's own spec.subagents is never read, and a
// subagent gets no boot directory to hold definitions in.
