// alone and had that hazard; nothing in the portfolio had tripped it yet.
//
// The list being hardcoded is what makes it safe to hardcode: the two ways of
// being wrong about it fail differently. A key missing from it that should be
// here fails loudly and immediately — "5s" reaches a time.Duration field and
// encoding/json refuses to unmarshal a string into one, on the first boot, by
// name. A key here that should not be is the silent case above. So the list
// errs toward the failure that reports itself, and a key added to it later
